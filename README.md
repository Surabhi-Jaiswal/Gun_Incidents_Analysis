# Gun Incidents Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of gun-related incidents from 2017 to 2019. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, gender, race, education, reason for the incident, and police involvement, providing insight into critical patterns and trends.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 100,798 entries and 12 attributes, including:
- Year: Year of the incident
- Month: Month of the incident
- Reason: Suicide, Homicide, etc.
- Education: Education level of the individual involved
- Sex: Gender of the individual involved
- Age: Age of the individual
- Race: Race of the individual involved
- Place of Incident: Location of the incident (e.g., Home, Street)
- Police Involvement: Whether police were involved or not

## Visualizations
